# Tinkerbunk

This repo is basically me learning some zig.
Just recreational programming doing some probably useless stuff

## TODO:
This is pool of ideas of what to implement in zig

- [x] naive ls implementation
- [ ] naive socket server
- [ ] naive grep implementation
- [ ] render some stuff with sdl
- [ ] play with raylib
- [ ] interop with c project
