# Tinkerbunk

This repo is basically me learning some zig.
Just recreational programming doing some probably useless stuff

## Why zig?
* C but without buid tool complexity, I "love" wasting time with makefiles
* minimalistic and powerfull at the same time
* more developer and less verbose than rust
* no llm or copilot suport

## TODO:
This is pool of ideas of what to implement in zig

- [ ] simple neural networks - in progress
- [ ] basic ml algorithms
- [ ] pong
- [ ] simple web server
- [ ] esp32 stuff
- [ ] simple os
- [ ] naive docker clone
- [ ] naive data storage
- [ ] naive git
- [ ] improve cli args parser
- [ ] play with markow chains
- [ ] btree index for toy db
